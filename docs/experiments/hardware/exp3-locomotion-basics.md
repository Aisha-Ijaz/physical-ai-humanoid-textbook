# Experiment 3: Locomotion Basics (Hardware)

## Learning Objectives

After completing this experiment, you should be able to:
- Execute basic walking patterns on a humanoid robot platform
- Understand the relationship between center of mass and balance
- Analyze gait parameters and their effect on stability
- Implement simple locomotion control strategies
- Appreciate the challenges in bipedal locomotion

## Equipment Required

- Humanoid robot platform with bipedal locomotion capability
- Flat, clear walking space (minimum 3x3 meters)
- Measuring tape or distance markers
- Computer with locomotion control software
- Safety equipment and spotters
- Charging station for the robot

## Safety Requirements

⚠️ **CRITICAL SAFETY MEASURES:**
- Ensure adequate space for robot movement
- Have personnel ready to intervene if robot loses balance
- Keep clear of robot's potential fall zone
- Never operate without proper supervision
- Have emergency stop procedures ready

## Setup Procedure

### Robot Preparation
1. Verify the robot is fully charged
2. Check all leg joints for proper function
3. Calibrate balance sensors if necessary
4. Position robot at starting location

### Environment Setup
1. Clear walking area of all obstacles
2. Mark starting and ending positions
3. Ensure floor surface is even and non-slip
4. Position spotters around the walking area

## Experimental Procedure

### Part A: Basic Standing Balance
1. Command robot to stand in basic posture
2. Observe the robot's natural swaying behavior
3. Measure the center of pressure under each foot
4. Document the robot's balance recovery when gently perturbed

### Part B: Static Balance Tests
1. Command robot to shift weight to single leg
2. Observe balance maintenance strategies
3. Test various arm positions and their effect on balance
4. Document the limits of stable weight transfer

### Part C: Basic Step Execution
1. Execute single step in place
2. Observe the coordination of upper and lower body
3. Measure the time and forces during step execution
4. Verify the robot's balance after completing the step

### Part D: Straight Line Walking
1. Execute a sequence of steps in a straight line
2. Measure step length, step width, and cycle time
3. Observe the center of mass trajectory during walking
4. Document any deviations from ideal walking pattern

### Part E: Parameter Variation
1. Adjust walking speed and observe changes in gait
2. Modify step length and document effects on stability
3. Test different walking patterns (narrow vs wide stance)
4. Record the energy consumption for different parameters

## Expected Results

- Robot should maintain balance during static tests
- Step execution should be coordinated and stable
- Walking should exhibit regular gait patterns
- Parameter variations should show predictable effects on locomotion

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If robot loses balance: check calibration and surface conditions
- If walking is unstable: adjust balance control parameters
- If steps are inconsistent: verify joint control and calibration
- If robot stops walking: check for safety system activation

## Data Analysis

- Calculate average step length, width, and time
- Plot the center of mass trajectory during walking
- Assess the relationship between walking speed and stability
- Compare gait parameters to human walking data

## Discussion Questions

1. How do the robot's balance strategies compare to those discussed in Chapter 4 on Control Systems?
2. What are the limitations of the robot's locomotion compared to human walking?
3. How do the gait parameters affect the stability of the robot?

## Safety Verification

- Confirm robot was operated safely throughout experiment
- Verify all safety measures were maintained
- Ensure robot was properly powered down and secured

## Extensions

- Implement turning or curved path walking
- Add obstacle avoidance to the walking behavior
- Test locomotion on different surfaces
- Explore different walking speeds and their effects

## Next Steps

After mastering basic locomotion, proceed to Experiment 4: Perception System to understand how the robot can use its sensors while moving.
