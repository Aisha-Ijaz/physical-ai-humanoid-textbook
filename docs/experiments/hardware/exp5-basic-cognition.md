# Experiment 5: Basic Cognition (Hardware)

## Learning Objectives

After completing this experiment, you should be able to:
- Implement basic reasoning and decision-making algorithms
- Create simple learning systems for the robot
- Integrate perception, reasoning, and action in a complete system
- Test the robot's ability to adapt to new situations
- Understand the challenges in implementing cognitive functions on physical robots

## Equipment Required

- Humanoid robot platform with sufficient computational resources
- Computer with cognitive software development tools
- Various objects for cognitive tasks (blocks, containers, etc.)
- Workspace with clear areas for object manipulation
- Measuring tools and timers
- Objects for memory and recognition tasks

## Safety Requirements

⚠️ **SAFETY MEASURES:**
- Ensure safe interaction between robot and objects
- Keep workspace clear of unnecessary items
- Monitor robot behavior during cognitive tasks
- Follow proper handling procedures for all equipment

## Setup Procedure

### Robot Preparation
1. Power on robot and verify all systems
2. Load cognitive software onto robot
3. Verify that perception and actuation systems are functional
4. Calibrate any sensors needed for cognitive tasks

### Environment Setup
1. Arrange objects for cognitive tasks in the workspace
2. Set up clear areas for object manipulation tasks
3. Configure measurement tools for task performance
4. Ensure adequate space for robot movement during tasks

## Experimental Procedure

### Part A: Simple Decision Making
1. Program the robot to choose between two objects based on color
2. Test the decision-making process with various object pairs
3. Measure the accuracy and time of decisions
4. Introduce conflicts to test decision resolution
5. Document the robot's behavior under uncertainty

### Part B: Memory-Based Tasks
1. Implement a simple memory system for the robot
2. Task the robot with remembering object locations
3. Test recall after different time intervals
4. Assess the effect of distractions on memory performance
5. Document memory capacity and reliability

### Part C: Learning Through Repetition
1. Create a simple task the robot must perform repeatedly
2. Implement a learning mechanism to improve performance
3. Measure improvement over successive trials
4. Assess the robot's ability to generalize from examples
5. Document the learning curve and final performance

### Part D: Perception-Action-Reasoning Integration
1. Combine perception, reasoning, and action in a complete task
2. Example: Navigate to object of specific color and move it to target location
3. Test the system's ability to handle unexpected situations
4. Measure the overall system performance and reliability
5. Document how failures propagate through the system

### Part E: Adaptive Behavior
1. Create a task that requires adaptation to changing conditions
2. Implement a simple adaptation mechanism
3. Test the robot's ability to adjust behavior based on feedback
4. Assess the speed and accuracy of adaptation
5. Document the limits of adaptive behavior

## Expected Results

- Decision-making should be accurate and timely
- Memory system should successfully store and recall information
- Learning should improve performance over time
- Integrated system should complete tasks successfully
- Adaptive behavior should respond appropriately to changes

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If decisions are inconsistent: verify sensor accuracy and decision parameters
- If memory fails: check data storage and retrieval implementation
- If learning doesn't improve performance: verify learning algorithm
- If system integration fails: debug components individually first
- If adaptation is slow: adjust learning rates or parameters

## Data Analysis

- Calculate decision accuracy and response times
- Measure memory recall accuracy and decay over time
- Plot learning curves showing performance improvement
- Assess the success rate of integrated tasks
- Evaluate the effectiveness of adaptive mechanisms

## Discussion Questions

1. How do the integration challenges in physical robots compare to theoretical models in Chapter 6?
2. What are the main limitations of implementing cognition on physical robots?
3. How do real-time constraints affect cognitive processing?

## Safety Verification

- Confirm robot operated safely during cognitive tasks
- Verify all equipment handled properly
- Ensure workspace maintained safely

## Extensions

- Implement more complex reasoning algorithms
- Add social cognition capabilities
- Test learning in more challenging domains
- Implement multi-modal cognitive processing

## Next Steps
