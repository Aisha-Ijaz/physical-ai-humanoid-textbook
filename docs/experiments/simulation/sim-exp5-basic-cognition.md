- Simulated adaptive behavior should respond appropriately to changes

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If simulated decisions are inconsistent: verify sensor simulation and decision parameters
- If simulated memory fails: check data structures and simulation timing
- If simulated learning doesn't improve performance: verify algorithm implementation
- If system integration fails: debug components individually first in simulation
- If simulation runs slowly: reduce complexity of cognitive algorithms

## Data Analysis
