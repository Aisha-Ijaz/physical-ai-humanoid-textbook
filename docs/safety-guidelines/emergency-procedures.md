# Emergency Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines the emergency procedures to be followed when operating humanoid robots. These procedures are designed to minimize risk to human safety and property damage in case of unexpected situations or malfunctions.

## Emergency Classification

### Level 1: Minor Incident
- No immediate danger to personnel
- Robot continues operation but shows anomalous behavior
- Can be addressed without immediate intervention

### Level 2: Hazardous Situation
- Potential risk to personnel or property
- Robot behavior is unusual but not immediately dangerous
- Requires immediate attention and possible shutdown

### Level 3: Emergency Situation
- Immediate risk to personnel or property
- Robot behavior poses clear danger
- Requires immediate activation of emergency procedures

## Emergency Response Team Roles

### Emergency Coordinator
- Coordinates overall emergency response
- Communicates with emergency services if needed
- Makes decisions about facility evacuation if necessary

### Robot Operator
- Activates emergency stop procedures
- Provides real-time information about robot behavior
- Assists with evacuation procedures

### Safety Officer
- Assesses safety conditions during incidents
- Ensures personnel follow safety protocols
- Coordinates first aid if needed

### Technical Lead
- Evaluates robot technical status
- Determines if safe intervention is possible
- Coordinates recovery procedures

## Emergency Equipment Locations

⚠️ **KNOW THE LOCATION OF:**
- Emergency stops for all robot systems
- Fire extinguishers (Class C-rated for electrical fires)
- First aid kits
- Emergency communication devices
- Evacuation routes and assembly points

## Robot Emergency Stop Procedures

### Immediate Robot Stop
1. **Press the main emergency stop button** (typically red mushroom-style button)
2. **If the main stop fails**, use the secondary emergency stop
3. **If robot has remote stop capability**, activate from safe location
4. **Never attempt physical intervention** while robot is moving unexpectedly

### Power Isolation
1. Turn off main power switch to robot if accessible and safe
2. Disconnect battery power if it's safe to approach the robot
3. Lock out and tag out power sources if trained to do so
4. Verify that all robot motion has ceased

## Specific Emergency Procedures

### Fire Emergency
⚠️ **ROBOT FIRE EMERGENCY:**
1. Activate emergency stop procedures first
2. If fire is electrical, use Class C fire extinguisher only
3. Call emergency services if fire is spreading
4. Evacuate the area immediately if fire cannot be controlled
5. Never use water on electrical fires or lithium battery fires

### Person Caught or Trapped by Robot
⚠️ **PERSON TRAPPED BY ROBOT:**
1. Activate emergency stop immediately
2. Do not move the robot until the person is free
3. Assess injuries and provide appropriate first aid
4. Call emergency medical services if needed
5. Only trained personnel should attempt to free the person

### Electrical Shock
⚠️ **ELECTRICAL SHOCK INCIDENT:**
1. **DO NOT TOUCH THE VICTIM** if they are in contact with electrical source
2. Cut off power to the robot immediately
3. Call for emergency medical services
4. Provide first aid if the victim is no longer in contact with electrical source
5. Monitor for delayed symptoms

### Gas Leak or Hazardous Vapor
1. Evacuate all personnel from the area immediately
2. Activate emergency ventilation if available
3. Call emergency services if the leak is substantial
4. Do not attempt to repair the leak without proper training
5. Account for all personnel at evacuation assembly point

### Structural Damage to Robot
1. Stop all robot operations immediately
2. Assess potential for additional structural failure
3. Maintain safe distance from damaged robot
4. Do not attempt repairs without proper evaluation
5. Document the damage before any movement of robot

## Evacuation Procedures

### Evacuation Decision
- The Emergency Coordinator determines when evacuation is necessary
- Evacuation is mandatory for Level 3 emergencies
- Consider evacuation for Level 2 situations that are deteriorating

### Evacuation Process
1. Announce evacuation over emergency communication system
2. All personnel move to designated evacuation routes
3. Robot operators activate emergency stops and secure robots as time allows
4. Account for all personnel at assembly point
5. Await instructions from Emergency Coordinator or emergency services

### Assembly Point
- Primary: [Designated safe area away from robot operations]
- Secondary: [Backup location if primary is compromised]

## Post-Emergency Procedures

### Immediate Actions
- Account for all personnel
- Provide medical attention if needed
- Secure the area to prevent additional incidents
- Preserve evidence for incident investigation

### Incident Documentation
- Complete incident report form
- Document robot and environmental conditions
- Collect witness statements
- Photograph any damage if safe to do so
- Report to appropriate authorities if required

### System Evaluation
- Professional assessment of robot before return to service
- Review and update safety procedures if needed
- Additional training for personnel if procedures were inadequate
- Equipment inspection and maintenance requirements

## Communication Procedures

### Internal Communication
- Primary: [Communication system details]
- Backup: [Backup communication method]
- Emergency contacts: [List of key personnel and numbers]

### External Communication
- Emergency services: 911
- Facility management: [Contact information]
- Robot manufacturer support: [Contact information]
- Institutional emergency services: [Contact information]

## Training and Drills

### Emergency Procedure Training
- All personnel must complete emergency procedure training
- Training includes hands-on practice with emergency equipment
- Review emergency procedures annually or after incidents
- Document emergency training completion

### Emergency Drills
- Conduct emergency drills quarterly
- Include all types of potential emergencies
- Evaluate response times and effectiveness
- Update procedures based on drill results

## Emergency Equipment Maintenance

### Regular Checks
- Test emergency stop systems regularly
- Inspect fire extinguishers monthly
- Verify emergency communication systems weekly
- Check first aid supplies monthly

### Inspection Records
- Document all emergency equipment inspections
- Track maintenance activities
- Ensure equipment remains in serviceable condition
- Replace expired or damaged equipment immediately

## Special Considerations

### Multi-Robot Environments
- Emergency procedures for multiple robots
- Coordination between robot emergency systems
- Evacuation procedures for large robot areas
- Communication systems for multiple robot operations

### Public Events or Demonstrations
- Enhanced safety procedures for public areas
- Additional emergency equipment for larger crowds
- Public evacuation procedures
- Coordination with venue emergency services

Remember: In any emergency, human safety is the top priority. When in doubt, activate emergency procedures and err on the side of caution. Regular practice of emergency procedures will ensure appropriate response when needed.
