# General Safety Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the general safety guidelines that must be followed when working with humanoid robots. These guidelines apply to all interactions with robotic systems regardless of their specific configuration or purpose.

## Critical Safety Principles

⚠️ **ALWAYS FOLLOW THESE PRINCIPLES:**

### 1. Risk Assessment First
- Conduct a thorough risk assessment before beginning any interaction with humanoid robots
- Identify potential hazards associated with robot motion, weight, and environment
- Consider the consequences of unexpected robot behavior
- Document and communicate all identified risks

### 2. Safe Operating Environment
- Maintain a clear workspace free of obstacles and unnecessary personnel
- Ensure adequate space for robot movement and human safety
- Mark safety zones around the robot where humans should not enter during operation
- Establish emergency exits that remain clear during robot operation

### 3. Proper Supervision
- Never leave humanoid robots unattended during operation
- Maintain visual contact with the robot at all times
- Have qualified personnel present who can intervene if necessary
- Establish clear roles and responsibilities for all individuals in the robot area

### 4. Emergency Procedures
- Know the location and operation of all emergency stop mechanisms
- Establish clear communication protocols for emergencies
- Have a physically safe location where personnel can retreat during emergencies
- Regularly practice and review emergency procedures

## Pre-Operation Safety Requirements

### Equipment Inspection
- Inspect the robot for any visible damage or wear that could affect safety
- Verify all safety systems are functional
- Check that all cables and connections are secure
- Confirm that the robot is properly calibrated

### Workspace Preparation
- Clear the workspace of personnel not directly involved in operations
- Remove obstacles that could interfere with robot motion
- Ensure lighting is adequate for safe operation
- Verify the robot has a stable, level surface to operate on

### Personnel Briefing
- Ensure all personnel understand their roles and responsibilities
- Review emergency procedures with all personnel
- Verify that all personnel understand safety boundaries
- Confirm that appropriate safety equipment is available and used

## During Operation Safety Requirements

### Monitoring Requirements
- Continuously monitor robot behavior for unexpected actions
- Watch for signs of mechanical or electronic failures
- Verify that the robot remains within expected operational parameters
- Monitor the workspace for changes that could affect safety

### Intervention Guidelines
- Be prepared to initiate emergency stop procedures immediately if needed
- Follow established protocols for robot intervention
- Never attempt to manually stop robot motion without proper procedures
- Maintain safe distances from moving parts at all times

## Post-Operation Safety Requirements

### Safe Shutdown
- Follow proper robot shutdown procedures
- Verify that all robot motion has ceased
- Secure the robot if it will remain in position
- Return the workspace to its normal state

### Equipment Check
- Inspect the robot for any damage sustained during operation
- Document any safety-related incidents
- Ensure all safety systems remain functional
- Secure any temporary safety equipment

## Special Considerations

### Working with Multiple Robots
- Establish clear operational zones for each robot
- Implement coordination protocols to prevent collisions
- Increase supervision requirements with additional robots
- Ensure communication systems between robot controllers

### Interaction with Humans
- Maintain safe separation distances during operation
- Implement collision avoidance systems
- Establish clear protocols for human-robot interaction
- Use appropriate safety barriers when needed

### Environmental Factors
- Adjust safety procedures for different environments
- Consider the impact of temperature, humidity, and lighting
- Account for different flooring surfaces and their effect on robot motion
- Plan for power outages or other environmental disruptions

## Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

### Required PPE
- Safety glasses to protect from potential debris
- Closed-toe shoes with non-slip soles
- Close-fitting clothing to prevent entanglement
- Hard hat if operating under potential falling objects

### Situational PPE
- Additional protection may be required based on specific tasks
- Hearing protection for high-noise environments
- Hand protection when appropriate (gloves when not creating additional risk)

## Training Requirements

### Basic Training
- All personnel must complete basic robot safety training before interaction
- Training must be documented and kept current
- Refresher training required annually or after safety incidents
- Specialized training for personnel with operational roles

### Emergency Response Training
- All personnel must know emergency procedures
- Designated personnel must be trained in first aid
- Practice emergency scenarios regularly
- Update procedures based on experience

## Documentation and Reporting

### Incident Reporting
- Report all safety incidents, near-misses, and safety concerns
- Document all robot malfunctions that could affect safety
- Maintain records of safety training
- Conduct post-incident reviews to prevent recurrence

### Safety Audits
- Regularly audit safety procedures and their implementation
- Review and update safety guidelines as needed
- Conduct risk assessments periodically
- Ensure safety systems remain current with technology

Remember: Safety is everyone's responsibility. When in doubt, always err on the side of caution and prioritize human safety over any operational objectives.
