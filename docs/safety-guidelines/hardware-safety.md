# Hardware Safety Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides specific safety guidelines for working with physical humanoid robot hardware in experimental settings. These guidelines supplement the General Safety Guidelines and address the unique risks associated with physical robotic systems.

## Mechanical Safety

### Joint and Actuator Hazards
⚠️ **CRITICAL MECHANICAL SAFETY:**
- Be aware of all robot joints and their potential range of motion
- Never place hands, clothing, or objects near moving joints during operation
- Maintain safe distances from robot extremities during motion
- Understand the force and speed capabilities of each actuator

### Pinch and Crush Points
- Identify all potential pinch and crush points on the robot
- Never insert hands or objects into joint mechanisms
- Be aware of how robot movement creates new pinch hazards
- Use proper tools for any necessary adjustment or maintenance

### Weight and Stability
- Be aware of the robot's weight distribution and center of gravity
- Never attempt to support the robot's weight manually
- Ensure the robot is properly secured when powered down
- Be prepared for the robot's weight when necessary to move manually

## Electrical Safety

### Power Systems
⚠️ **CRITICAL ELECTRICAL SAFETY:**
- Verify all electrical connections are secure before operation
- Never work on electrical systems while the robot is powered on
- Be aware of high-power motors and their electrical requirements
- Check for frayed or damaged cables that could create hazards

### Battery Safety
- Follow proper procedures for charging and handling robot batteries
- Monitor battery temperature during charging and operation
- Never puncture, modify, or improperly dispose of batteries
- Store batteries in appropriate containers away from heat sources

### Emergency Power Down
- Know the location and operation of all emergency power-off switches
- Understand the process for safe emergency shutdown
- Practice emergency procedures regularly
- Verify that emergency systems function properly

## Operational Safety

### Movement Safety
- Always announce robot movements before they begin
- Ensure clear paths for all robot motion
- Maintain awareness of the robot's intended movement sequence
- Be prepared to stop motion if unexpected behavior occurs

### Environmental Hazards
- Assess the workspace for hazards before robot operation
- Keep the robot away from water, extreme temperatures, or corrosive materials
- Ensure adequate ventilation for any robot systems that produce heat or emissions
- Protect the robot from environmental hazards that could affect safety systems

### Load Handling
- Never overload robot manipulator systems beyond their rated capacity
- Verify payload securement before movement
- Consider dynamic loads during robot motion
- Use appropriate lifting equipment when necessary

## Maintenance Safety

### Regular Inspections
- Conduct visual inspections of critical components before each session
- Check for wear on cables, joints, and structural elements
- Verify that safety systems function as expected
- Document inspection results

### Adjustments and Modifications
- Only qualified personnel should make adjustments to robot hardware
- Power down and disconnect power before making adjustments
- Follow manufacturer specifications for all adjustments
- Verify all safety systems after any modifications

### Cleaning and Care
- Follow proper procedures for robot cleaning
- Never use excessive force when cleaning robot surfaces
- Avoid cleaning solutions that might damage robot surfaces or electronics
- Ensure the robot is completely dry before operation

## Human-Robot Interaction Safety

### Physical Interaction
- Use appropriate safety protocols for any necessary physical contact with the robot
- Implement force limiting in interactive applications
- Ensure operators understand safe interaction procedures
- Use appropriate barriers when interaction occurs

### Supervision Requirements
- Maintain direct supervision during all robot operation
- Ensure sufficient qualified personnel for the complexity of tasks
- Implement communication protocols between operators
- Establish clear responsibility boundaries

## Emergency Procedures

### Robot Malfunction
1. Initiate emergency stop if robot behavior poses immediate danger
2. Safely evacuate the area if necessary
3. Do not attempt to approach the robot until safe to do so
4. Notify appropriate personnel immediately
5. Document the incident thoroughly

### Human Injury
1. Provide immediate first aid if safely possible
2. Call for emergency medical services if needed
3. Secure the robot and make the area safe
4. Preserve evidence of the incident
5. Initiate incident reporting procedures

### Fire or Explosion Risk
1. Evacuate personnel immediately
2. Call emergency services
3. If safe to do so, cut off robot power
4. Use appropriate fire suppression equipment
5. Follow building evacuation procedures

## Special Considerations

### Multiple Robot Environments
- Establish clear operational zones for each robot
- Implement collision avoidance systems
- Increase supervision requirements with additional robots
- Ensure communication systems between robot controllers

### Public Demonstrations
- Implement additional safety barriers for public interaction
- Increase safety personnel ratio
- Reduce robot motion complexity and speed
- Ensure comprehensive safety briefing for all participants

## Training Requirements

### Hardware-Specific Training
- Complete training on the specific robot platform to be operated
- Understand the mechanical and electrical characteristics of the robot
- Practice all safety procedures in a supervised environment
- Maintain current certification on safety procedures

### Emergency Response
- Training on emergency procedures specific to the robot platform
- Regular practice of emergency scenarios
- Knowledge of first aid and emergency response procedures
- Clear understanding of emergency contact procedures

Remember: When working with hardware humanoid robots, the potential for serious injury exists. Always prioritize safety over experimental objectives and stop operations if safety is compromised.
