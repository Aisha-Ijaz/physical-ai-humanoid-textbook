# Sample Page with Integrated Chatbot

This is a sample page demonstrating how the chatbot can be integrated into any documentation page.

## Example 1: Full-width chatbox


## Example 2: Using the chatbot for specific section

You can ask questions related to this section using the chatbot above. For example, you could ask:

- "What are the key concepts in this textbook?"
- "Explain humanoid locomotion"
- "How do perception systems work in robotics?"

The chatbot will search the entire textbook content to provide accurate answers with citations.

## Example 3: Another section

The chatbot remains available throughout your session and continues to provide answers based on the full book content as you explore different sections.
