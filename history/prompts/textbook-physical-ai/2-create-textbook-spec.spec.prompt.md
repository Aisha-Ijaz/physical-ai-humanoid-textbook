## Prompt

Generate a full specification for the textbook "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics," including chapter requirements, learning outcomes, tools, hands-on experiment guidelines, safety rules, Docusaurus documentation structure, and acceptance criteria. Beginner-to-intermediate audience.

## Response snapshot

I have successfully completed the feature specification for the textbook "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics." Here is the summary:

**Branch name**: 1-textbook-physical-ai
**Spec file path**: C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\Hackathon1\\specs\\1-textbook-physical-ai\\spec.md
**Checklist results**: All quality checklist items have been validated and completed
**Readiness for next phase**: The specification is ready for the planning phase (`/sp.plan`)

The specification includes:
1. Three prioritized user stories covering content access, hands-on experiments, and safety guidelines
2. Twelve functional requirements addressing textbook content, navigation, safety rules, and learning outcomes
3. Eight measurable success criteria focusing on student learning and satisfaction
4. Six key entities defining core concepts of the textbook
5. Edge cases addressing hardware limitations and student prerequisites

The specification quality checklist shows that all requirements have been met, with all items marked as completed.
