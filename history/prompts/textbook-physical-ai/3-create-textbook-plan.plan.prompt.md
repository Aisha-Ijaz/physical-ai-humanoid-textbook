## Prompt

Create a complete project plan for building the textbook "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" using the constitution and specification already generated. Include phases, milestones, deliverables, timelines, risks, and dependencies. Make the plan practical and ready for execution.

## Response snapshot

I have created a complete project plan for building the textbook "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics". The implementation plan includes:

- Summary of the textbook project with key features
- Technical context detailing the technology stack
- Constitution check ensuring alignment with textbook principles
- Project structure outlining the organization of content
- Research summary documenting key decisions
- Data model defining the textbook entities
- Quickstart guide for using the textbook

The plan follows the constitution principles of beginner-friendly approach, practical application focus, interdisciplinary integration, visual learning support, progressive complexity building, and ethical considerations.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive implementation plan for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook
- 🧪 Tests: (none)
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, and contracts/ in specs/1-textbook-physical-ai/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.tasks to generate development tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully created a detailed implementation plan that aligns with the textbook's educational goals and constitution principles.
