## Prompt

Create a complete task breakdown for building the textbook "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics," based on the existing constitution, specification, and plan. Include writing tasks, chapter tasks, experiment tasks, Docusaurus tasks, review tasks, and publishing tasks.

## Response snapshot

I have created a complete task breakdown for building the textbook "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" with the following phases:

1. Setup Phase: Project initialization and basic Docusaurus structure
2. Foundational Phase: Core infrastructure that blocks other user stories
3. User Story 1: Access Textbook Content (Priority P1) - Creating chapters with beginner-friendly approach
4. User Story 2: Complete Hands-On Experiments (Priority P2) - Creating hardware and simulation experiments
5. User Story 3: Follow Safety Guidelines (Priority P3) - Creating safety guidelines and integrating with experiments
6. Media and Visual Resources: Adding visual learning support
7. Quality Assurance and Review: Ensuring compliance with constitution principles
8. Publishing and Deployment: Deploying the completed textbook
9. Polish Phase: Cross-cutting improvements

The task breakdown includes 83 specific tasks (T001-T083) with proper dependencies, parallelization opportunities, and organization by user story priority.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive task breakdown for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook
- 🧪 Tests: (none)
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md in specs/1-textbook-physical-ai/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation of the textbook
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully created detailed task breakdown that aligns with constitution principles and enables parallel development.
